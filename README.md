#  Decentralized Exchange Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a simplified version of Uniswap V1, a decentralized exchange protocol built on Ethereum. The implementation uses Foundry as the development framework, providing a robust environment for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. Token Contract (`src/Token.sol`)
- ERC20 token implementation that will be used for trading on the exchange
- Currently implements basic counter functionality (needs to be updated to ERC20 standard)
- Features:
  - Token minting and burning capabilities
  - Standard ERC20 transfer and approval functions
  - Total supply management

#### 2. Exchange Contract (`src/Exchange.sol`)
- Core DEX implementation (to be implemented)
- Key Features (planned):
  - Constant Product Market Maker (x * y = k)
  - Liquidity pool management
  - Token swapping functionality
  - Liquidity provider token minting/burning

## Technical Workflow

### 1. Liquidity Pool Creation
1. Users deposit equal values of ETH and ERC20 tokens
2. Receive liquidity tokens representing their share of the pool
3. Initial exchange rate is determined by the initial deposit

### 2. Token Swapping
1. Users specify input token and desired output amount
2. Smart contract calculates exchange rate using x * y = k formula
3. Applies fee (0.3% following Uniswap V1 model)
4. Executes swap if slippage requirements are met

### 3. Liquidity Management
1. Liquidity providers can add liquidity by depositing both assets
2. Removal of liquidity requires burning LP tokens
3. Returns proportional share of both assets in the pool

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Foundry installed
- Solidity ^0.8.13
- Git for version control

```

### Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dex-app
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
forge install
```

3. Build the project
```bash
forge build
```

4. Run tests
```bash
forge test
```

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite for all contract functionality
- Integration tests for complex swap scenarios
- Fuzzing tests for edge cases
- Gas optimization tests

## Security Considerations
1. Reentrancy protection
2. Integer overflow/underflow protection (using Solidity ^0.8.13)
3. Proper access control for admin functions
4. Price manipulation resistance
5. Slippage protection

## Gas Optimization Strategies
1. Efficient storage usage
2. Optimized math operations
3. Batch processing where applicable
4. Strategic use of view functions

## Future Improvements
1. Implementation of flash loans
2. Price oracle integration
3. Enhanced security features
4. Gas optimization improvements
5. Additional trading pair support
